        -   struggle to find motivation and express meaning from a personal perspective
-   merely: clever but aberrant or arbitrary method of thinking
    -   no reference to the enabling analytical, emotional, physical or interpersonal capabilities
-   needed: situated and sensate learning environments
-   needed: model creativity by the teachers for the students
-   "What If?" "Why not?"
-   accepting multiple or differentiated student achievements against a given range of qualitative criteria
    -   rather than narrowly prescribed, moderate or standardized specific student outcomes for quality assurance
-   **"lived experience", "individual intuition", "interpersonal relations", "shared values", "emotion and motivation"**
-   **increasingly confident inclination to explore**
-   psychological and practical confidence
-   creative engagement and action
-   general human potentiality and context-dependant behavioural attribute
-   acute anxiety is often associated with a crisis of confidence
-   teachers should be coaches instead of masters
-   students need to be convinced, cajoled, coaxed and coerced to step beyond the status quo

#### Conclusion

-   marshalling and releasing creativity renew sustainable elements of human resources
-   qualitative shift of focus and educational priorities from the traditional transmission of disembodied information
-   focus on the whole of person values and attitudes
