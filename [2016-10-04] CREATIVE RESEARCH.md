## Creativity Research

> creativity has emotional component: effective life?

-   Books: Creative Innovators, Global Achievement Gap, Growing Up Creative, Evolutionary Approaches to Creativity, ++?
-   Neural Paths: Branching off from group paths to individual solution = Lateral Thinking
-   brain size and development is connected to creativity, larger = more creative (not weight, but complexity, folds)
-   mental flexibility evolved
-   100,000 yrs had ability, only started using it 40,000 yrs ago
-   infant raising connected? Playfulness connected to creativity
-   Play = suppose? "Suppose this is true, what happens?"
-   open ended questions

### Conformity vs. Creativity
> Need an even balance
> Evolutionary Paradox

-   necessary factors in evolution
-   early human species prone to imitation (conformity)

**Pros**:
-   (conservative thinking or) conforming behaviour is a survival tool
    -   easier to survive challenges
    -   safer within groups
-   Positive outcomes when groups get together
-   Group thinking is the basis for culture
-   Energy saving when working with others

**Cons**:
-   Stunted growth when conforming
-   Creativity is harder
-   Group think can snuff out ideas

##### Non-conformists
-   sensitive to change
-   can more easily spot opportunities for innovation (valuable)

##### Conformists
-   Evaluation and implementation for fruitful and useful solutions
-   Replicate innovation: repetition and propagation
-   By repeating, you draw into culture

### Lateral Thinking vs. Vertical Thinking

> debono diamond

**Lateral**: Spread idea out (wide)  
**Vertical**: Best vs worst? (high)  

-   lateral thinking === divergent thinking
-   vertical thinking === convergent thinking
-   lateral represents completely other ways of doing things
-   vertical represents different efficiencies of same idea
-   Test; TTCT: Tolerance Test of Creative Thinking (1995-2008)
    1.  Fluency (number of possible responses)
    2.  Flexibility (different kinds of responses)
    3.  Originality (new, different responses)
    4.  Elaboration (detail on responses)
        -   Clearly shows that students in the US are becoming less and less creative
        -   focused on divergent thinking
        -   lessened lateral thinking

##### How to think lateral
-   open ended questions
-   remake metaphors
-   force your mind to find connections from subject to seemingly unrelated things

### Adaptor - Innovator Theory

> What is it that you are really interested in?

-   Adaptive Thinking / Innovative Thinking
-   Different perspectives
-   Styles of creative thinking / innovation
    -   adapt ideas
    -   new ideas
-   "Style Approach": All people fall under the scale of adaptation and innovation
-   High creative innovation / low creative innovation
    -   rate of idea generation
-   **Need both adaptors and innovators**
    -   both need to work together to come up with viable solutions
    -   **adapters improve practices**
    -   **innovators come up with new directions**


### Bloom's Taxonomy
-   Describes human thought as a continuum from least complex to more complex
-   structured and complex
    1.  **Remembering**, Recall information, facts
    2.  **Understanding**, explain, comprehend, make meaning
    3.  **Application**, implementation, use of information
    4.  **Analyzing**, differentiate, categorize
    5.  **Evaluation**, critical thinking about information
    6.  **Creativity**, changing information/ideas to meet new standards
-   Human thought is a product of complexity
-   Different levels feed into each other
-   Patterns of other levels built into each level

-----
-   "Extended Effort Principle": 20 sentences
    -   First third of sentences are least original
    -   Last third are most original
    -   lateral thinking
-   divergent and convergent thinking nullify each other
-   need to separate styles
-   improve by learning when to use each style

## Innovation Generation
### Chapter Six

-   Keen observation involves overcoming metaphors and frames, habits
-   acute watching of world around
-   but world around is shaped by metaphors and frames
-   more efficient to not be a keen observer
-   editing observations reinforce frames of reference
-   familiarity is ordinary, differences are removed unconsciously
    -   numbed thinking, blind perceptions
-   cognitive frames direct observation, need to act against them
-   new info -> inferences
    -   we allow what we expect to see what we actually see
    -   "change mindness"

### Chapter Seven

-   Training for keen observation
-   "Savage Detectives"
-   Tools:
    1.  Learn to Draw/Drafts: visual diagrams of ideas
        -   Breaks down inhibitions
    2.  Observe the Field, observation in practice
    3.  Notice Inconsistencies
    4.  Pay attention to details otherwise not seen
-   Company: *IDEO*, (design firm, Quality Improvement)
    -   combination of productive styles
    -   outside of comfort zones, push boundaries of what is possible
    -   summary:
        1.  Understand the market, client, tech, limitations
        2.  Observe the real life situation
        3.  Visualize concepts
        4.  Evaluate and refine
        5.  implementation of ideas
    -   Team is aware of what works and what doesn't work
-   Improve keen observation:
    1.  Overcome natural tendencies to observe selectively
    2.  Take time to observe in the real world (avoid arm chair thinking)
    3.  Question the flaws in designs and paradigms/frames that are in play
-   "Enhance observational keenness by learning to hone the senses", get out there and do it. Learn to observe and criticize.

### Chapter Eight
-   Bias gets in the way of observation
-   observing is processing sensory, thinking is processing decisions (risk/benefit)
    -   **when process becomes automatic, thats when bias gets in the way**
-   automatic risk/benefit assessments === bias
-   irrational thinking, cognitive bias (cognitive frames)
    -   systematic mental errors, inaccurate assessment

-   contextual bias
    -   frames around comparison
    -   "group think"
    -   **evaluating actions based on deviations from others**
    -   Examples of contextual inhibitions:
        1.  Anchoring Effect: *base a decision on the first thing you see*
        2.  Perseverance Effect: *Holding on to original beliefs, even when proven wrong or ineffectual, filtering of inputs (ex. placebo)*
        3.  Hindsight Effect: *We think we remember more accurately than in reality*

### Chapter Nine
-   Be aware of cognitive bias is the first step to defeating them
-   Step by Step:
    1.  define the decision that you are going to make
    2.  Identifying the frames around your thinking
    3.  Come up with alternatives
    4.  Consider the consequences of each alternative (pick best one)

### Chapter Ten and Eleven
-   Brain functions, physical attributes of creativity
-   Unique thinking comes from mental integration of attributes (left right half?)
-   training yourself to mentally integrate all parts of the brain
-   conduit of creativity: funnelled from brain into reality through prefrontal lobe
    -   relational complexity
    -   chunks (frames): frontal lobe has packaged complexity, simplification
    -   Innovation frame hypothesis?
-   prefrontal cortex: jekyl and hyde
    -   both playful and unappealing
